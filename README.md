# Learn2Code

Learn2Code is a platform designed to assist users in learning coding. It leverages the power of generative AI to dynamically generate coding concepts and questions, providing an interactive and adaptive learning experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Uses generative AI to produce coding concepts and questions on-the-fly.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Tailors the learning experience based on user input and preferences.
- **Web Integration**: Easily integrates with web platforms to provide a seamless learning experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Google Colab account.
- An ngrok account for generating public URLs for local deployments.

### Setup and Deployment

1. **Run the Colab Notebook**: Start by running the provided Colab notebook. This will set up the environment and initialize the generative AI model.

2. **Ngrok Authentication**: Enter your ngrok authentication token when prompted. Ngrok is utilized to expose the local machine as a public endpoint, enabling the website to make API calls.

3. **Retrieve the Ngrok URL**: After executing all the cells in the Colab notebook, ngrok will provide a public URL.

4. **Plug into the Website**: Take the ngrok-provided URL and input it into the website. This allows the website to make API calls to the backend running on Colab.

## Note

The platform uses a quantized model to ensure faster inference times and compatibility with Google Colab's free tier. As a result, while the model is optimized for speed, there might be occasional trade-offs in accuracy. Some outputs generated by the model might not always meet expectations, but it's designed to provide a satisfactory learning experience for most users.
